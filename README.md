# Dainty

A Minecraft mod that adds in a bunch of small quality of life changes.

## Feature List

- Removes farmland trampling
- Allows jumping onto fences
- Removes phantom spawning (+ adds phantom membrane as a configurable 50% enderman drop)

All features are disableable and can have their values tweaked via the mod's config.
