/**
 * <h1>Dainty</h1>
 * 
 * The main package for the dainty mod. This package contains the entire Dainty mod, and in itself only contains the main mod file ({@link violet.dainty.Dainty})
 * 
 * <h2>Structure</h2>
 * 
 * Most of the code for Dainty is in the {@code violet.dainty.features} package. This package contains individual sub-packages for each feature; See the {@code package-info.java}
 * file in the {@code features} parent package for more information.
 * 
 * <br/><br/>
 * 
 * Mixins, which must be stored separately, are in {@code violet.dainty.mixins}; This too is detailed in the {@code features} {@code package-info.java} file.
 * 
 * <br/><br/>
 * 
 * Registries are stored in {@code violet.dainty.registries}. This is where things such as custom items, blocks, potions, etc. are created and registered.
 * 
 * <br/><br/>
 * 
 * Resources are stored in {@code /src/main/resources} with the standard Neoforge resource structure; See <a href="https://docs.neoforged.net/docs/resources/">The relevant part
 * of the Neoforge docs</a> for more information.
 * 
 * <h2>More Information</h2>
 * 
 * Documentation for more specific parts of the mod, such as individual features, are documented within the code of that feature. Reference any {@code package-info.java} files for
 * high-level overviews and good starting points. As always, {@code README.md} in the project root is a good place to check for documentation too.
